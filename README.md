# 🍂✨ September Challenge – Autumn Productivity App ✨🍂



> *“If September was a desktop app, it would smell like cinnamon, glow like pumpkin candles, and play lo-fi beats while you study.”*

## 🧡 About This Project

Hi! I’m **Bruna** 👋 — this is my first real **Electron + JavaScript** app.

I tried Tkinter twice during the Codédex Copilot course (it was cute but not *me*), and I wanted a real challenge. This autumn I finally jumped into Electron, JavaScript, CSS and let Copilot help me turn a vibe into code.

I’m still a perfectionist and still working on features — but right now I’m in love with how cozy it feels 🥰.

* Color palette = instant autumn vibes.

## 🤖 GitHub Copilot Adventures

Copilot was my co-pilot for:

* Autocompleting Electron boilerplate.
* Suggesting JavaScript functions for the timer & progress bar.
* Debugging CSS (especially making circles 😭➡️😊).
* Tiny style tweaks at 3 AM.

## 🍬 Life Updates While Coding

* Cola cans: **“don’t count”** 😅
* Sweet snacks: “lost track after 20” 🍫
* Lo-fi beats: **on repeat 12 hours**
* Canva + Figma: hate it. love it. hate it. love it.
* Mood: *Pumpkin Spice Determination™*

---

## 📚 What I Learned

* How to build an **actual app** with ElectronJS from scratch.
* DOM manipulation & event handling in vanilla JavaScript.
* CSS variables for consistent colors.
* How to ask Copilot for help like a pro.
* That perfectionism + lo-fi beats = a dangerous combo.
